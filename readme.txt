Website Structure Explanation 

File Structure:
 

index.html:  The main HTML file containing the website's content.
styles.css: (Linked in the `<head>`) Contains CSS rules for styling the page.

 

HTML Structure (index.html):
 

 1.<!DOCTYPE html>` and <html>:
    Standard HTML5 document structure.
 2.<head>:
  * Contains metadata:
  * <meta charset="UTF-8">`: Character encoding.
  * <meta name="viewport"...>`:  Viewport settings for responsiveness.
  * <title>`:  Title of the page (appears in the browser tab).
  * <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`: Links to the external CSS file.
 3.<body>:
  * Contains the visible content of the page:
  * <header>:
  * Contains the site's main heading (<h1>) and navigation (<nav>).
  * The navigation has an unordered list (<ul>) with links (<a>) to different sections of the page (using anchor links like #about, #projects, etc.).
  * <section id="about">:
  * Contains the "About Me" section with a heading (<h2>) and introductory text (<p>).
  * <section id="projects">:
  * Contains the "My Projects" section.
  * Uses a <div> with class projects-grid to hold individual project items.
  * Each project (<div class="project-item">) includes:
  * An image (<img>).
  * A project title (<h3>).
  * A project description (<p>).
  * <section id="blog">:
  * Contains the "Blog" section.
  * Uses <div> elements with classes blog-posts and blog-post to structure blog entries.
  * Each blog post includes a title (<h3>), date (<p>), and content (<p>).
  * <footer>:
  * Contains the "Contact Me" information (heading, text, email link, etc.).
  * Also includes a copyright notice.
  * <script src="js/scripts.js">: Links to the external JavaScript file (placed at the end of the body).
 

Key Points:
 

 * Sections: The page is divided into main sections (about, projects, blog, contact) using the <section> tag and id attributes for navigation.
 * Navigation: The navigation menu uses anchor links (#section-id) to link to these sections within the same page.
 * Content Structure: Headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>), paragraphs (<p>), images (<img>), lists (<ul>, <li>), and links (<a>) are used to structure the content.
 * CSS for Styling: The visual presentation (layout, colors, fonts, etc.) is handled by the external styles.css file.
